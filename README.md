# personal-karabiner-60-
kingston's karabiner bindings for 60% keyboard

better 60% keyboards for mac users:

|what it does|what I type (mapped to on my keyboard)|
|---------|-------|
|arrows|ctrl + hjkl vim style|
|ctrl|capslock|
|cmd+` for like swapping tabs| cmd+esc on a 60% keyboard|


I've been experimenting with \ as backspace but I'm too lazy to learn it. Also, marginal difference â€” my right ring finger is long so I can reach the backspace.

Also for some reason it's easier to reach upwards than right-upwards for pinky? Not sure

I'm prob going to change vim style arrow movement to something more intuitive like jikl for left down up right in that order... will need to experiment with colemak though.

Also I think it's worth learning vim-style controls. For now at least.
