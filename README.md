# personal-karabiner-60-
kingston's karabiner bindings for 60% keyboard

better 60% keyboards for mac users:

|what it does|what I type (mapped onto my 60% keyboard)|
|---------|-------|
|arrows|ctrl + jikl|
|ctrl|capslock|
|cmd+` for like swapping tabs| cmd+esc on a 60% keyboard|
|media controls| pgup, pgdn|
|fn key| left ctrl, this is used for "delete" holding fn key and pressing backspace|
|right cmd | right alt|


I've been experimenting with \ as backspace but I'm too lazy to learn it for this keyboard at least. 

Also, marginal difference â€” my right ring finger is long enough that I can reach the backspace.

Also for some reason it's easier to reach upwards than right-upwards for pinky? Not sure
