# personal-karabiner-60-
kingston's karabiner bindings for 60% keyboard

better 60% keyboards for mac users:

|what it does|how my keyboard handles it|
|---------|-------|
|arrows|ctrl + hjkl vim style|
|capslock|ctrl|
|cmd ` for like swapping tabs| cmd esc on a 60% keyboard|


been experimenting with \ as backspace but i'm too lazy to learn it. Also marginal difference, my right ring finger is long as heck so i can reach the backspace.

Also for some reason it's easier to reach upwards than right-upwards for pinky? not sure

i'm prob going to change vim style arrow movement to something more intuitive like jikl for left down up right in that order... will need to experiment with colemak though.
